					     <h3></br><p> Welcome! I am Vlad, astrologer, <span title="I trained as a transformational coach with Animas Coaching.">UK trained coach</span>, and intuitive human with a big <span aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-lg fa-heart fa-anim-vertical-shake" style="color:#FF0064"></span></b></h3>
					     </br>I am also a person who strongly believes that <b>there is no such thing as a "one-size-fits-all"</b>. 
					     </br>My life so far has had been characterised by a burning desire to understand myself and others. All of the lessons I learned so far about the way humans tick have helped me grasp the value of a wise and actively empathetic ear to one's individuality and the needs arising from it.
					     Being honored as a unique person with unique needs and requirements in order to live and thrive is, in my experience, the best to grow in life.
					     </br></br>Your life's journey will surely be different from mine, so you might wonder how a stranger can be of help to you. All I can say is that I enjoy connecting with conscious people who are either dedicated to a path, or looking for their path. Seekers of lasting satisfaction in a life dominated by work, 
					     creators of meaning, collectors of value, nurturers of life, fighters for peace, architects of emotions, and souls experiencing pain, darkness, loneliness, the overwhelming speed of modern life, or the pressure of unshared love in their hearts.
					     </br></br>If you feel so inclined, I invite you on a discovery journey sprinkled with some challenges and complex questions followed by breakthroughs, awe, and satisfaction. By connecting consciously with this process you will eventually be rewarded by a definitive step forward in your life and an increase in your authenticity. 
					     </br></br>Wherever you find yourself in life, <u>my promise to you</u> is help you realize that the person you thought you are is no match for the person you truly are ðŸ˜‰
					     </br>P.S. My bike in some of the pictures stands as a reflection of my values: freedom, <span title="She's frugal and light, with only 125CC.">agility</span>, and self-determination. Also, it looks cool.
