					     I am Vlad, astrologer, <span title="I trained as a transformational coach with Animas Coaching.">UK trained coach</span>, and intuitive human with a big <span aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-lg fa-heart fa-anim-vertical-shake" style="color:#FF0064"></span></b></h3>
					     </br>I am also a person who strongly believes that <b>there is no such thing as a "one-size-fits-all"</b>. 
					     </br>My life is characterised by a burning desire to understand myself and the reality of human sensitivity. All the lessons learned so far have shown me the value of listening rather than simply reacting.
					     As a guide and as a person, my aim is to honor people as individuals with unique needs. Doing so helps everyone grow, including me.
					     </br></br>Your journey will surely be different from mine, so you might wonder if a stranger can be of much help to you. I see guidance as a special kind of partnership. One that allows us both to connect as conscious individuals who are either dedicated to a path, or looking for their path. So far, I have partnered with seekers of lasting satisfaction, 
					     creators of meaning, collectors of value, nurturers of life, fighters for progress, architects of emotions, and souls experiencing pain, darkness, loneliness, the overwhelming speed of modern life, or the pressure of unshared love in their hearts.
					     </br></br>If you feel so inclined, I invite you on a discovery journey sprinkled with exciting challenges, breakthroughs, awe, and satisfaction. By connecting consciously with this process you will eventually be rewarded with a definitive step forward in your life and an increase in your authenticity. 
					     </br></br>Wherever you find yourself in life, <u>my promise to you</u> is to help you realize that the person you thought you are is no match for the person you truly are ðŸ˜‰
					     </br>P.S. My bike in some of the pictures stands as a reflection of my values: freedom, <span title="She's frugal and light, with only 125CC.">agility</span>, and self-determination. Also, it looks cool. </br></br>
