					     <h3></br><p> Welcome! I am Vlad, astrologer, <span title="as transformational coach with Animas Coaching">trained coach</span>, and intuitive human with a big <span aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-lg fa-heart fa-anim-vertical-shake" style="color:#FF0064"></span></b></h3>
					     </br>I am also one of those increasingly rare people who enjoy their "day job". After working in various companies, holding various roles,
					     and nearly experiencing a burnout, I saw the light!
					     </br></br><b><u>It was me!</u></b> 
		 			     </br></br>I was the one setting myself up for exhaustion, creating and maintaining a negative approach to my work, the environment, and my colleagues.
					     Slowly, very slowly, I began changing and I am happy to tell you that it lead to a major shift and transformation.
					     I am no longer giving my authority away believing that something outside of me is responsibile for my satisfaction and well-being. As a result, I am happy and motivated by my work,
					     creative and confident around all my colleagues, and most importantly, my effort is sustainable.   
				             </br></br>Your journey will likely be different from mine, yet I work with numerous people who are struggling with achieving lasting satisfaction in a life dominated by work. 
					     Not to mention <b>all the things we run away from</b>: emotions, pain, darkness, feeling lonely, feeling overwhelmed by the speed of modern life or by the amount of love in our hearts that we are unable to share.					     If you resonate with this I invite you to join me on a discovery journey sprinkled with breakthroughs, awe, and satisfaction, eventually rewarded by a definitive step forward in your life and an increase in your personal authority. 
					     </br></br>In a nutshell, my promise to you is to help you realize that the person you thought you are is no match to the person you truly are ðŸ˜‰
